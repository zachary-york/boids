A basic boids implementation written in javscript and using the HTML canvas to display.

I used create-react-app to use for the app skeleton because it is what I am most familiar with right now and I thought it would be nice to use if I ever wanted to add interactivity in the future (e.g. editing parameters on the fly, pausing the simulation, etc)

The main business logic is located in the "src/utilities/" directory.
